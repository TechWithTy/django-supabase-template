## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Django-Supabase Template on Hetzner Cloud using Coolify as the deployment platform. This combination offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-manage infrastructure for your application.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have:

- A Hetzner Cloud account
- A domain name for your application
- Git repository with your Django-Supabase Template project
- Supabase project already set up
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization

## Hetzner Setup

### Creating a Hetzner Account

1. Visit [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) and sign up for an account
2. Verify your email address and set up payment information
3. Create a new project in the Hetzner Cloud Console

### Server Selection

For the Django-Supabase Template, we recommend the following server configurations based on your expected traffic:

- **Development/Testing**: CX11 (1 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **Small Production**: CX21 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Medium Production**: CX31 (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- **Large Production**: CX41 (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM)

To create a server:

1. In the Hetzner Cloud Console, click "Add Server"
2. Select your preferred location (datacenter)
3. Choose Ubuntu 22.04 as the operating system
4. Select your server type based on the recommendations above
5. Add your SSH key (highly recommended for security)
6. Give your server a name (e.g., `django-supabase-prod`)
7. Click "Create & Buy Now"

### Server Configuration

Once your server is created, connect to it via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

Update the system and install basic requirements:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y curl git docker.io docker-compose ufw
```

Enable and start Docker:

```bash
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker
```

### Network Setup

Configure the firewall to allow only necessary traffic:

```bash
# Allow SSH
ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow HTTP and HTTPS
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443/tcp

# Enable the firewall
ufw enable
```

If you're using Hetzner's Cloud Firewall, create a new firewall with the following rules:

- Allow incoming traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS)
- Allow all outgoing traffic

Attach this firewall to your server.

## Coolify Setup

[Coolify](https://coolify.io/) is an open-source, self-hostable Heroku/Netlify alternative that simplifies the deployment process.

### Installing Coolify

Run the following command on your Hetzner server to install Coolify:

```bash
sh <(curl -fsSL https://coolify.io/install.sh)
```

Follow the installation prompts:

1. Choose the installation type (usually "All-in-one")
2. Enter your server's public IP address when prompted
3. Set up your admin email and password

After installation, Coolify will be accessible at `http://your_server_ip`.

### Configuring Coolify

1. Log in to Coolify using the credentials you set during installation
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "General" and configure:
   - Set your domain name if you have one
   - Configure email settings for notifications
3. Set up SSL certificates:
   - Go to "Settings" > "SSL"
   - Enable Let's Encrypt for automatic SSL certificate management
   - Add your domain

## Deploying Django-Supabase Template

### Project Setup in Coolify

1. In Coolify, navigate to "Resources" > "New Resource"
2. Select "Application"
3. Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and connect your repository
4. Select the Django-Supabase Template repository
5. Choose "Docker Compose" as the deployment method

### Environment Variables

Configure the necessary environment variables in Coolify:

1. Go to your application settings in Coolify
2. Navigate to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Add the following variables (adjust values as needed):

```
# Django Settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your_domain.com,www.your_domain.com

# Database Settings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/django_db

# Supabase Settings
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_supabase_db_password
SUPABASE_DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_supabase_connection_string

# Redis Settings
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# Email Settings
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

### Database Configuration

For production deployments, you have two options:

1. **Use Supabase Database** (Recommended):
   - Ensure your Supabase connection details are correctly set in the environment variables
   - Make sure your Hetzner server's IP is allowed in Supabase's database access controls

2. **Use a Local PostgreSQL Database**:
   - In your docker-compose.yml, ensure the PostgreSQL service is properly configured
   - Set up volume mounts for data persistence
   - Configure backup strategies (see Backup Strategy section)

### Deployment Process

1. In Coolify, go to your application dashboard
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Coolify will:
   - Pull your repository
   - Build the Docker images
   - Start the containers according to your docker-compose.yml
   - Set up reverse proxy with SSL

4. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
5. Once deployment is complete, your application will be accessible at your configured domain

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Grafana and Prometheus

The Django-Supabase Template includes Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring. To access these tools:

1. **Prometheus**: Available at `https://your_domain.com:9090`
2. **Grafana**: Available at `https://your_domain.com:3000`

Default Grafana credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

Change these credentials immediately after first login.

The template includes pre-configured dashboards for:
- Django application metrics
- System metrics
- Database performance

### Logs and Debugging

Access logs through Coolify's interface:

1. Go to your application in Coolify
2. Navigate to the "Logs" tab
3. Select the service you want to view logs for (backend, celery, etc.)

For more detailed logs, connect to your server and use Docker commands:

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# View logs for a specific container
docker logs -f container_name
```

### Backup Strategy

Implement a regular backup strategy:

1. **Database Backups**:
   - If using Supabase, enable point-in-time recovery
   - For local PostgreSQL, set up pg_dump scheduled backups:

   ```bash
   # Create a backup script
   cat > /root/backup.sh << 'EOL'
   #!/bin/bash
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
   BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/postgres"
   mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
   
   # Run pg_dump inside the container
   docker exec postgres pg_dump -U postgres django_db | gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/django_db_$TIMESTAMP.sql.gz"
   
   # Keep only the last 7 daily backups
   find $BACKUP_DIR -type f -name "django_db_*.sql.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
   EOL
   
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x /root/backup.sh
   
   # Add to crontab to run daily at 2 AM
   (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * /root/backup.sh") | crontab -
   ```

2. **Media Files Backup**:
   - Set up regular backups of your media files:

   ```bash
   # Create a backup script for media files
   cat > /root/backup_media.sh << 'EOL'
   #!/bin/bash
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
   BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/media"
   mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
   
   # Backup media files
   tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/media_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" -C /path/to/your/media .
   
   # Keep only the last 7 daily backups
   find $BACKUP_DIR -type f -name "media_*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
   EOL
   
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x /root/backup_media.sh
   
   # Add to crontab to run daily at 3 AM
   (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 3 * * * /root/backup_media.sh") | crontab -
   ```

3. **Off-site Backups**:
   - Consider setting up rsync to an off-site location or using a service like Backblaze B2 or AWS S3

## Scaling

As your application grows, you can scale in several ways:

1. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Upgrade your Hetzner server to a larger instance
   - In Hetzner Cloud Console, select your server and click "Resize"
   - Choose a larger server type and follow the prompts

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - For more advanced setups, consider deploying multiple application servers
   - Use Hetzner Load Balancers to distribute traffic
   - Configure session persistence with Redis

3. **Database Scaling**:
   - If using Supabase, upgrade your plan as needed
   - For self-hosted PostgreSQL, consider read replicas or connection pooling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application Not Starting**:
   - Check the application logs in Coolify
   - Verify environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure the docker-compose.yml file is valid

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify database credentials in environment variables
   - Check if the database server is accessible from your Hetzner server
   - For Supabase, ensure your server's IP is in the allowed list

3. **SSL Certificate Problems**:
   - Verify your domain is correctly pointing to your Hetzner server's IP
   - Check Coolify's SSL settings
   - Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open in your firewall

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Check Grafana dashboards for bottlenecks
   - Consider scaling your server (see Scaling section)
   - Optimize database queries and implement caching
