# Grafana Monitoring Setup for Django-Supabase Template

## Overview

This document describes how to use Grafana for monitoring your Django application. The setup includes:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Pre-configured dashboards for Django monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Django-Prometheus package (already included in requirements.txt)

## Configuration

The monitoring stack is already configured in the project with:

1. **Prometheus** - Collects metrics from your Django application
2. **Grafana** - Visualizes the metrics with pre-built dashboards

## Starting the Monitoring Stack

To start the monitoring stack, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start your Django application along with Prometheus and Grafana services.

## Accessing Grafana

Grafana is available at: http://localhost:3000

Default credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

## Available Dashboards

Two pre-configured dashboards are available:

1. **Django Overview** - General metrics about your application including:
   - HTTP requests by method
   - HTTP responses by status
   - Request latency by view
   - Database operations

2. **Django Requests** - Detailed request metrics including:
   - Requests by view
   - Exceptions by type
   - Request latency (P95) by view
   - Response status by view

## Adding Custom Metrics

You can add custom metrics to your Django application using the django-prometheus library:

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

# Create a counter metric
my_counter = Counter('my_counter_total', 'Description of my counter')

# Use in your code
my_counter.inc()  # Increment by 1
my_counter.inc(10)  # Increment by 10

# Create a histogram metric
my_histogram = Histogram('my_histogram_seconds', 'Description of my histogram')

# Use with context manager
with my_histogram.time():
    # Code to measure
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Metrics Showing in Grafana

1. Check if Prometheus is running: http://localhost:9090
2. Verify that your Django application is exposing metrics at `/metrics`
3. Check Prometheus targets at http://localhost:9090/targets to ensure your application is being scraped

### Grafana Can't Connect to Prometheus

1. Check if the Prometheus data source is configured correctly in Grafana
2. Verify network connectivity between Grafana and Prometheus containers

## Extending the Monitoring Stack

You can extend the monitoring stack by:

1. Adding more dashboards in `config/grafana/dashboards/`
2. Configuring alerts in Grafana
3. Adding additional exporters for system metrics (Node Exporter, cAdvisor, etc.)
